## Project Overview

This project detects human faces in images or video streams using **OpenCV**, an open-source computer vision library. The system uses a pre-trained **Haar Cascade Classifier** to locate faces in real-time.

---

## Objective

- Detect human faces from images or live webcam feed.  
- Draw bounding boxes around detected faces.  
- (Optional) Extend the project for face recognition or mask detection.
